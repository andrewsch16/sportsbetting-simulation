# sportsbetting-simulation
A way to run a simulation for the expected profit from EV betting over time!

Just input your starting amount, win rate, and amount of bets and see a simulation of how much $$ you would make!

<b><i>All percentages need to be input as a value between 0-1. For example .56 as 56% </b></i>

this is using binomial distribution and is simulating <b>using prizepicks on a 5-pick flex play. </b>

NOTE - to calculate how much you would make with a specific edge, make sure you add the edge ON TOP of the vig added by prizepicks. For example if you wanted to simulate with a 3% edge on each bet, you would need to input 57% because it's ~54.4% that prize picks has at your breakeven win %.

more options coming soon including use for different sportsbooks and different length plays.

you can see the odds and calculate EV using this spreadsheet -- (credit to @AlexMonahan100 on twitter for making this!)
