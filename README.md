# sportsbetting-simulation
A way to run a simulation for the expected profit from EV betting over time!

<b>All percentages need to be input as a value between 0-1. For example .56 as 56% </b>

this is using binomial distribution and is simulating <b>using prizepicks on a 5-pick flex play. </b>

more options coming soon including use for different sportsbooks and different length plays.

you can see the odds and calculate EV using this spreadsheet -- (credit to @AlexMonahan100 on twitter for making this!)
